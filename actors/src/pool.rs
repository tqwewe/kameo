//! Provides a pool of actors for task distribution and load balancing.
//!
//! The `pool` module offers the ability to manage a group of actors that work together to process tasks.
//! It enables the creation of an `ActorPool`, which distributes incoming messages to a fixed set of worker actors
//! in a least-connections fashion. This ensures that messages are always sent to the worker with the least amount of
//! work queued.
//!
//! `ActorPool` must be spawned as an actor, and tasks can be sent to it using the `WorkerMsg` message
//! for individual workers or the `BroadcastMsg` to send a message to all workers in the pool.
//!
//! # Features
//! - **Load Balancing**: Messages are distributed among a fixed set of actors in a least-connections manner.
//! - **Resilience**: Workers that stop or fail are automatically replaced to ensure continued operation.
//! - **Flexible Actor Management**: The pool can manage any type of actor that implements the [Actor] trait,
//!   allowing it to be used for various tasks.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use kameo::Actor;
//! use kameo_actors::pool::{ActorPool, Broadcast, Dispatch};
//! # use kameo::message::{Context, Message};
//!
//! #[derive(Actor)]
//! struct MyWorker;
//! #
//! # impl Message<&'static str> for MyWorker {
//! #     type Reply = ();
//! #     async fn handle(&mut self, msg: &'static str, ctx: &mut Context<Self, Self::Reply>) -> Self::Reply { }
//! # }
//!
//! # tokio_test::block_on(async {
//! // Spawn the actor pool with 4 workers
//! let pool_actor = ActorPool::spawn(ActorPool::new(4, || MyWorker::spawn(MyWorker)));
//!
//! // Send tasks to the pool
//! pool_actor.tell(Dispatch("Hello worker!")).await?;
//! pool_actor.tell(Broadcast("Hello all workers!")).await?;
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! # });
//! ```
