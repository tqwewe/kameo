## Metrics

Kameo supports a `metrics` feature flag, which keeps track of the number of messages and signals sent and received across actors.

```toml
kameo = { version = "*", features = ["metrics"] }
```

With the feature flag enabled, you can install any supported global recorder compatible with the [metrics] crate.

Some common exporters include:

- [metrics-exporter-tcp] - outputs metrics to clients over TCP
- [metrics-exporter-prometheus] - serves a Prometheus scrape endpoint

## Hotpath

For observability in your terminal, a TUI called [hotpath] is available and supported by kameo.

![Hotpath TUI Example](https://github.com/pawurb/hotpath/raw/main/hotpath-tui5.gif)

This can be enabled with the `hotpath` feature flag in kameo:

```toml
kameo = { version = "*", features = ["hotpath"] }
```

You'll also need to install the hotpath TUI:

```bash
cargo install hotpath --features tui
```

Once installed, you can run your kameo app, and in another terminal run `hotpath` to immediately get live usage metrics.
