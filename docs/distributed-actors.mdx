title: Distributed Actors
---

Kameo’s distributed actor system enables actors to communicate seamlessly across different nodes in a decentralized network. This architecture provides a powerful foundation for building fault-tolerant, scalable, and resilient distributed systems. At its core, Kameo leverages [libp2p](https://libp2p.io) for peer-to-peer communication and a decentralized actor registry.

#### Key Components

- **ActorSwarm**: The central structure responsible for managing peer-to-peer communication between nodes. It initializes the libp2p swarm, manages connections, and coordinates actor registration and message routing.
- **RemoteActorRef**: A reference to an actor that resides on a remote node. This reference abstracts away the networking details and allows you to interact with remote actors using familiar APIs.
- **Multiaddress**: libp2p uses multiaddresses to specify how nodes can be reached using different network protocols like TCP, WebSockets, or QUIC. Multiaddresses are essential for routing messages between nodes.
- **Kademlia DHT**: Kameo uses Kademlia DHT to store and retrieve actor registration details. When an actor is registered, its name is stored as a key in the DHT, and the value contains information about how to reach the actor, making it discoverable by other nodes.

#### How Distributed Actors Work

1. **Bootstrapping the Actor Swarm**: Each node in the network must initialize an `ActorSwarm` to participate in the distributed system. The swarm manages the libp2p connections and allows the node to register actors and send/receive messages.

2. **Actor Registration**: After bootstrapping the swarm, actors can be registered under unique names. Once registered, the actor’s address is propagated through the Kademlia DHT, making it discoverable by other nodes.

3. **Remote Messaging**: Once an actor is registered, other nodes can look it up and send messages to it. The `RemoteActorRef` allows you to send and receive messages across the network without worrying about the underlying networking.

#### Why Use Distributed Actors?

Distributed actors are ideal for building systems that need to scale horizontally across multiple machines or geographic locations. They enable fault-tolerant systems, as nodes can fail or be added without disrupting the overall network. Some common use cases for distributed actors include:

- **Real-Time Systems**: Chat systems, multiplayer games, and real-time data monitoring where actors need to communicate with low latency.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Building independent services that communicate via message passing, while maintaining resilience to failures.
- **IoT Systems**: Distributed control systems where devices communicate with each other using lightweight actors.

#### Key Benefits

- **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of failure. Actors can be registered, discovered, and messaged from any node in the network.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The system continues to operate even if nodes fail or become unreachable. Actor registration via Kademlia DHT ensures nodes can find each other.
- **Scalability**: Add more nodes to the swarm to handle more actors and distribute load across the network.
- **Flexible Networking**: By using libp2p, Kameo supports various network protocols, allowing it to adapt to different environments and infrastructure.
