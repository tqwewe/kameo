title: Bootstrapping Actor Swarm
---

Before actors can communicate across nodes in a distributed system, you need to initialize the `ActorSwarm`. The `ActorSwarm` is responsible for managing peer-to-peer connections, actor registration, and message routing across nodes. This section explains how to bootstrap the swarm, set up network listening, and prepare your system for distributed communication.

#### Initializing the Actor Swarm

The first step in setting up distributed actors is bootstrapping the `ActorSwarm`. This initializes the swarm, allowing the node to participate in the network and accept incoming connections.

```rust
let actor_swarm = ActorSwarm::bootstrap()?;
```

This will initialize the swarm with default settings, preparing the node to listen for connections from other nodes. Once bootstrapped, you can register actors and send messages.

#### Bootstrapping with Identity

In some cases, you may want to bootstrap the swarm with a specific identity (keypair). This allows nodes to be uniquely identified in the network, which can be useful for secure communication or when interacting with known peers.

```rust
let keypair = Keypair::generate();
let actor_swarm = ActorSwarm::bootstrap_with_identity(keypair)?;
```

The `Keypair` generates a cryptographic identity for the node. This is useful for secure, verifiable communication between peers. The node will now be identified by its `PeerId`, derived from the keypair.

#### Listening on a Multiaddress

After bootstrapping the swarm, you need to instruct the node to listen on a specific network address. Kameo uses libp2p’s **multiaddress** format, which allows nodes to specify how they can be reached over the network. Multiaddresses define the protocol (e.g., TCP or QUIC) and the IP address/port combination.

```rust
actor_swarm.listen_on("/ip4/0.0.0.0/udp/8020/quic-v1".parse()?).await?;
```

In this example, the node is listening on the IP address `0.0.0.0` (which represents all available network interfaces) on UDP port `8020`, using the QUIC protocol. You can customize this address based on your network environment or use different protocols as needed.

#### Example: Bootstrapping and Listening

Here’s a full example that combines bootstrapping the swarm and setting up a listener:

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Bootstrap the swarm with a default identity
    let actor_swarm = ActorSwarm::bootstrap()?;

    // Start listening on a multiaddress
    actor_swarm.listen_on("/ip4/0.0.0.0/udp/8020/quic-v1".parse()?).await?;

    // The node is now ready to register actors and communicate with other nodes
    Ok(())
}
```

Once the swarm is bootstrapped and listening, the node can register actors, dial other peers, and send messages. This setup ensures the node is part of the network and ready to accept and route messages.

#### What’s Next?

Now that your node is part of the distributed system, it’s time to explore how to connect to other nodes and establish communication. In the next section, we’ll cover how to dial and connect to peers using multiaddresses.
