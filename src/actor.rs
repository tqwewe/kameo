//! Core functionality for defining and managing actors in Kameo.
//!
//! Actors are independent units of computation that run asynchronously, sending and receiving messages.
//! Each actor operates within its own task, and its lifecycle is managed by hooks such as `on_start`, `on_panic`, and `on_stop`.
//!
//! The actor trait is designed to support fault tolerance, recovery from panics, and clean termination.
//! Lifecycle hooks allow customization of actor behavior when starting, encountering errors, or shutting down.
//!
//! This module contains the primary `Actor` trait, which all actors must implement,
//! as well as types for managing message queues (mailboxes) and actor references ([`ActorRef`]).
//!
//! # Features
//! - **Asynchronous Message Handling**: Each actor processes messages asynchronously within its own task.
//! - **Lifecycle Hooks**: Customizable hooks ([`on_start`], [`on_stop`], [`on_panic`]) for managing the actor's lifecycle.
//! - **Backpressure**: Mailboxes can be bounded or unbounded, controlling the flow of messages.
//! - **Supervision**: Actors can be linked, enabling robust supervision and error recovery systems.
//!
//! This module allows building resilient, fault-tolerant, distributed systems with flexible control over the actor lifecycle.
//!
//! [`on_start`]: Actor::on_start
//! [`on_stop`]: Actor::on_stop
//! [`on_panic`]: Actor::on_panic

/// Core behavior of an actor, including its lifecycle events and how it processes messages.
///
/// Every actor must implement this trait, which provides hooks
/// for the actor's initialization ([`on_start`]), handling errors ([`on_panic`]), and cleanup ([`on_stop`]).
///
/// The actor runs within its own task and processes messages asynchronously from a mailbox.
/// Each actor can be linked to others, allowing for robust supervision and failure recovery mechanisms.
///
/// Methods in this trait that return [`Self::Error`] will cause the actor to stop with the reason
/// [`ActorStopReason::Panicked`] if an error occurs. This enables graceful handling of actor panics
/// or errors.
///
/// # Example with Derive
///
/// ```
/// use kameo::Actor;
///
/// #[derive(Actor)]
/// struct MyActor;
/// ```
///
/// # Example Override Behaviour
///
/// ```
/// use kameo::actor::{Actor, ActorRef, WeakActorRef};
/// use kameo::error::{ActorStopReason, Infallible};
///
/// struct MyActor;
///
/// impl Actor for MyActor {
///     type Args = Self;
///     type Error = Infallible;

///
/// # Lifecycle Hooks
/// - [`on_start`]: Called when the actor starts. This is where initialization happens.
/// - [`on_panic`]: Called when the actor encounters a panic or an error while processing a "tell" message.
/// - [`on_stop`]: Called before the actor is stopped. This allows for cleanup tasks.
/// - [`on_link_died`]: Hook that is invoked when a linked actor dies.
///
/// # Mailboxes
/// Actors use a mailbox to queue incoming messages. You can choose between:
/// - **Bounded Mailbox**: Limits the number of messages that can be queued, providing backpressure.
/// - **Unbounded Mailbox**: Allows an infinite number of messages, but can lead to high memory usage.
///
/// Mailboxes enable efficient asynchronous message passing with support for both backpressure and
/// unbounded queueing depending on system requirements.
