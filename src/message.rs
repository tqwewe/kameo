//! Messaging infrastructure for actor communication in kameo.
//!
//! This module provides the constructs necessary for handling messages within kameo,
//! defining how actors communicate and interact. It equips actors with the ability to receive and respond
//! to both commands that might change their internal state and requests for information which do not alter their state.
//!
//! A key component of this module is the [`Context`], which is passed to message handlers, offering them a
//! reference to the current actor and a way to reply to messages. This enables actors to perform a wide range of
//! actions in response to received messages, from altering their own state to querying other actors.
//!
//! The module distinguishes between two kinds of communication: messages, which are intended to modify an actor's
//! state and might lead to side effects, and queries, which are read-only requests for information from an actor.
//! This distinction helps in clearly separating commands from queries, aligning with the CQRS
//! (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) principle and enhancing the clarity and maintainability of actor
//! interactions. It also provides some performance benefits in that sequential queries can be processed concurrently.
